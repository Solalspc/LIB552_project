Additions to LIB552:

The additions were made in the context of the modelisation of Kirchoff-Love plate's bending and stretching.

- Corrected deprecations of some integrations functions
- Added constructors for P and B matrices, see report for details
- Extended the mesh visualisations tools to mesh with more than dof - points pairs (i.e. if there are dofs not on the mesh vertices)
- try to extend to P2 elements.
